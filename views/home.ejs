                <h3><strong>Oak Tree</strong></h3>
                Oak trees are large, strong, and long-lived deciduous or evergreen trees known for their
                sturdy wood and lobed leaves. They produce acorns as fruit and are commonly found in the
                Northern Hemisphere. Oaks support a wide variety of wildlife and are often valued for shade and timber.
